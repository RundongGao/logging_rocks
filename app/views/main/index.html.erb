<div class='description'>
	<p> Climblog.org is a free open source web application for climbers to track their training history for better performance. </p>

	<p> Our goal is to provide climbers an easy to use tool to keep their every trainning data and generate quantitative report any where any time.</p>

	<p> At this moment climbers can sign up and start to track their climbing logs on this site and get a generic report. </p>

	<p> Also climbers can choose to go public with their climbing logs, so everyone can see their training and progress. </p>

	<p> This project is at it's very very early stage. Any kind of help will be much appreicated. If you have any new idea, suggestion, question or a bug to report about Climblog.org, please 
	 <a href="mailto:climblog.dev@gamil.com">send us an email</a>. 
	</p>

	<p>
		We are currently working on optimizing and adding unit test system to our side to provide
		more stable services to climbers along our continuing development.
